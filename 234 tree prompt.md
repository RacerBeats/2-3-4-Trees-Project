🧪 Option 2: Build a B-Tree from Scratch in Python

Create a simplified B-Tree or 2-3-4 Tree class with core functionalities and balancing logic.
🔨 Required Methods

    insert(int key) – Add a new key to the tree
    contains(int key) – Check whether a key exists
    inOrderTraversal() – Print all keys in sorted order
    remove(int key) – (Bonus) Delete a key and rebalance if necessary

📋 Technical Requirements

    Implement a 2-3-4 node structure with dynamic node splitting
    Each node should support up to 3 keys
    Nodes can have between 2 and 4 children

💡 Implementation Tips

    Start with a Node class to hold keys and children
    Use a test driver to insert 15–20 random integers
    Print in-order results to validate the structure

⭐ Extra Credit

Add a visual print method that shows the tree level by level
